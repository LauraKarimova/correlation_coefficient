# Algorithm for analyzing financial instruments based on correlation coefficient
> A large amount of research is currently being done on the relationship between stocks in order to find a more accurate and efficient method for predicting the price of stocks.
This work presents an algorithm that allows to find the relationship and its degree between two stocks based on historical data of the prices. Finding the degree of correlation between stocks will allow to build a model that predicts the price of a stock based on the historical data of another stock.
